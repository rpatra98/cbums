# CBUMS - Phase 1 Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ PostgreSQL Database Setup with Prisma
- Created Prisma schema with models for: `User`, `Company`, and `CoinTransaction`
- Added role-based access control with UserRole and EmployeeSubrole enums
- Set up relationships between entities
- Prepared migration scripts 

### 2. ✅ Prisma Client Configuration
- Set up a singleton Prisma client with proper error handling
- Created custom enums to fix TypeScript issues
- Added seed script to initialize the database with a SuperAdmin user

### 3. ✅ NextAuth Authentication System
- Implemented credentials provider (email & password)
- Set up session management and JWT handling
- Created login and register API routes
- Added authentication middleware to protect routes

### 4. ✅ Role Management
- Implemented role-based access control (RBAC)
- Only SuperAdmin can create Admin users
- Only Admin can create Companies and Employees
- Employees belong to a specific company
- Password hashing using bcrypt

### 5. ✅ API Routes
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login (via NextAuth)

- `POST /api/users/create` - Role-based user creation
- `POST /api/coins/transfer` - Transfer coins between users
- `GET /api/coins/history` - View coin transaction history

### 6. ✅ Middlewares and Utilities
- `withAuth` middleware for role-based API protection
- NextAuth middleware for route protection
- Prisma wrapper with error handling
- Type definitions for proper TypeScript integration

### 7. ✅ UI Scaffolding with TailwindCSS
- Login page with form
- Dashboard pages for each role:
  - SuperAdmin Dashboard
  - Admin Dashboard
  - Company Dashboard
  - Employee Dashboard
- Responsive header with user info and logout

## Next Steps

### Database Setup
Before moving to Phase 2, you need to:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally
2. Run database migrations using `npm run migrate`
3. Seed the database using `npm run db:seed`

### Phase 2 Planning
Ready to begin Phase 2 which will include:
- Session Management
- Seal Management
- Advanced Features

### Known Issues
- Some TypeScript lint errors still exist due to Prisma enum type issues
- Complete database functionality depends on having a running PostgreSQL server

### Running the Application
Once the database is set up:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Default SuperAdmin Credentials:
- Email: superadmin@cbums.com
- Password: superadmin123
